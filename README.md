## Lessons Learned
During the first week of this course, I learned quite a lot.

Switches and Numerical Systems were the main two topics in which I learned the most in.

But more than anything, in having been learning Python on my own, this week was really helpful in taking a lot of the
lessons that I have previously spent HOURS trying to wrap my head around and encapsulating them in a very straight forward and coherent
way.
